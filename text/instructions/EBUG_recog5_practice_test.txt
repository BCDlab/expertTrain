The practice test phase will begin shortly.Please indicate how well you recognize each creature using one of the response options (see below).In each trial, a creature will be presented for a short time on the screen. Please look at it carefully and withhold your response until the response options appear on the screen. Please keep your fingers on the keyboard during the entire recognition test.In the recognition test, you will see the learned creatures together with half as many new creatures. The new creatures can be very similar to those that you learned in the study block. Please try to remember whether the creature you see is one that you have already learned.Keep in mind that to recollect a creature means that you can consciously remember specific details of its appearance or of your experience learning the creature.Press "contKey" to begin the practice test phase.
