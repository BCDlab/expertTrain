After you make the old/new response, you will make a second response.

If you decided it was an old image, you will see "recallPromptText" and you should type the word that was previously paired with the image. Think about the word-image connection you formed earlier.
Please try to spell accurately; you can use the DELETE key to fix a typo, however you will not be penalized for spelling mistakes. It is OK to guess, but if you really cannot remember the word, simply press ENTER.

OR

If instead you decided it is a new image, you will then say whether you are "sure" about it by pressing the "newSureKey" key, or that it was "maybe" new by pressing the "newMaybeKey" key.

For the sure/maybe response, the key assignments will be visible as a reminder (see below), but please memorize the keys and avoid looking down at the keyboard or key assignments.

Press "contKey" to continue to the experiment.
