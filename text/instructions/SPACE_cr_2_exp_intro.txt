Response 2:
If you decide it is an old image, you will see "recallPromptText" and you should type the word that was paired with the image earlier. Think about the word-image connection you formed earlier. Please try to spell accurately, however you will not be penalized for spelling mistakes. If you really cannot remember the word, press ENTER.

Otherwise, if you decide it is a new image, you will then say whether you are "sure" about it by pressing the "newSureKey" key, or that it was "maybe" new by pressing the "newMaybeKey" key.

For the sure/maybe response, the key assignments will be visible as a reminder (see below), but please memorize the keys and avoid looking down at the keyboard or key assignments.
