This is the Naming experiment: block blockNum.

You will see creatures from nFamily families.
In this block, there are nSpecies different species in each family, and they are called species theseSpecies.

You will identify species theseSpecies from one family,
and you will chunk all species of the other family together as "basicFamStr".

Your job is to press the correct species key for each creature. If you don't know the species number, take your best guess.

key=species: s01=1, s02=2, s03=3, s04=4, s05=5, s06=6, s07=7, s08=8, s09=9, s10=10
"s00" is the key for the "basicFamStr" family species members.

Please place your fingers on the keys now.

Press "contKey" to begin the naming task.
