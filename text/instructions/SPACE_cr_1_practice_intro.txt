Practice

You will now see "old" images that you learned earlier mixed with "new" images you have not seen before, and you will make two responses for each.

First, you will decide whether the image is old or new.
If it is an old image, press the "recogOldKey" key.
Or, if it is a new image, press the "recogNewKey" key.

Please put your index fingers on recogOldKey and recogNewKey now.

These key assignments will be visible during the experiment as a reminder (see below), but please memorize the keys and avoid looking down at the keyboard or key assignments.

Press "contKey" to read about the second response.
