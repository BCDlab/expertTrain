Practice

You will now see "old" images that you learned earlier mixed with "new" images you have not seen before.

First, you will decide whether the image is old or new. If it is an old image, press the "recogOldKey" key. Or, if it is a new image, press the "recogNewKey" key.

These key assignments will be visible during the experiment as a reminder (see below), but please memorize the keys and avoid looking down at the keyboard or key assignments.

Press "contKey" to continue to the next instruction screen.
