This is recognition experiment. Block blockNum of 8 study-test blocks is about to begin.The recognition experiment will last about 1.5 hours.During all study AND test blocks in this experiment, we will record your brain activation. We are especially interested in your brain activation during the presentation of each creature.Please do not blink or move while a creature is being shown. Such movements disturb the recorded EEG.Throughout the experiment, there will be short breaks so that you can blink and rest your eyes.If you need to blink before a break screen appears, please wait until you see a fixation cross. Do not blink or move when a creature is shown.Press "contKey" to proceed.
