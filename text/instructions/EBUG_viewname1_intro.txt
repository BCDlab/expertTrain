Viewing task: block blockNum.

You will see creatures from nFamily families.
In this block, there are nSpecies different species in each family, and they are called species theseSpecies. These numbers correspond to the keys listed below.

Eventually you will learn all nSpeciesTotal, but in this block you will only learn species theseSpecies.

You will identify species theseSpecies from one family,
and you will chunk all species of the other family together as "basicFamStr".

Your job is to learn the family and species members by pressing the species key
that corresponds to the species number you see below each creature.

key=species: s01=1, s02=2, s03=3, s04=4, s05=5, s06=6, s07=7, s08=8, s09=9, s10=10
"s00" is the key for the "basicFamStr" family species members.

You will use the keys for species theseSpecies in this block.

Please place your fingers on the keys now.
