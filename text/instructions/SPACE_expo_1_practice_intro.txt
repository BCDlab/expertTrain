You are about to begin a PRACTICE version of the real experiment to familiarize you with the phases.

You will now see a series of pictures of people and living rooms.

Your job is to judge how appealing each person and living room is to you. These judgments are important for the remainder of the experiment, so please be honest, but also try to respond quickly.

Your options are "expo1Text", "expo2Text", "expo3Text", and "expo4Text".
You will indicate your response with the keys "expo1Key", "expo2Key", "expo3Key", and "expo4Key", respectively.

These key assignments will be visible during the experiment as a reminder (see below), but please memorize the keys and avoid looking down at the keyboard or key assignments.

Press "contKey" to continue.
