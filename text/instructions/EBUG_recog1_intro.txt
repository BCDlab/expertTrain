Welcome to the RECOGNITION experiment!In this experiment, we will test your ability to memorize and recognize creatures. We are especially interested in how well you remember creatures that you have seen only once.The whole experiment has 8 study-test blocks. In a single study block, you will see 40 creatures. In the study block, you should look at the creatures carefully and memorize them as best as you can. No task is required.After each study block, we will test your memory for the creatures that you learned in the study block immediately before the test block. In each test block, you will see all those learned creatures together with new creatures. There will only be half as many new creatures as old creatures.Press the space bar to proceed.
