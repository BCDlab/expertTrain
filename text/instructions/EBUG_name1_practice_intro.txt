This is the practice Naming experiment.

You will see creatures from nFamily families.
In this block, there are nSpecies different species in each family.

You will identify the different species of one family,
and you will chunk the other family together as "basicFamStr".

Your job is to press the correct species key for each creature. If you don't know the species number, take your best guess.

key=species: s01=1, s02=2, s03=3, s04=4, s05=5, s06=6, s07=7, s08=8, s09=9, s10=10
"s00" is the key for the "basicFamStr" family species members.

Please place your fingers on the keys now.

Press "contKey" to begin the naming task.
